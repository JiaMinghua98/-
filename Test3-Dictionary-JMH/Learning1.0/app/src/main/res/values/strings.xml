    <string name="text1">\t \t \t Certainly, every  person has bad habits.\n
        Some people may be in the habit of  \n
        speaking rudely; some tend to be deaf  \n
        to others’ opinions; some are inclined \n
        to delay. However, there is no doubt that \n
        allowing to be controlled by bad habits does \n
        a great harm to personal development.\n\n
        It is not too much to say that it is a \n
        destructive behavior to allow to be \n
        controlled by bad habits while it is \n
        constructive to change unwanted habits. \n
        If bad habits are allowed to be developed, \n
        they will get out of control and become big \n
        obstacles to life or career. For example, \n
        a delayed-prone person will hardly restrain \n
        himself from missing the deadline. \n
        Understandably, he will have few chances to\n
        be entrusted with important tasks and then will\n
        barely be professionally experienced enough to\n
        gain promotion. On the contrary, it is\n
        beneficial to change unwanted habits and \n
        acquire good ones, because good habits \n
        can make people more competent and thus \n
        widen the door to success.\n
　　In summary, bad habits will probably\n
        make it impossible for us to achieve\n
        our ambitions. Therefore, we should be \n
        alert to our bad habits and make \n
        persistent efforts to break them.</string>
